# Hospital Management System

This is my BCA final year project, a desktop application for managing hospital operations. It was developed at Arvind Hospital, Patna.

## What It Does
- Manage patient records (add, update, search, delete).
- Handle doctor and employee details.
- Track bed availability and departments.
- Record medical tests and generate bills.
- Create patient and bill reports.
- Secure login with username and password.

## Technologies Used
- Java (Swing for GUI)
- Oracle 10g (Database)
- NetBeans IDE 6.5
- JDBC-ODBC Bridge

## How to Run
1. Install Java 1.6 and Oracle 10g.
2. Run `sql/database.sql` to set up the database (if included).
3. Open the project in NetBeans IDE 6.5 and run.

## Files
- Java source code: Check `.java` files.
- Documentation: Check Word/PDF file.
- Database: Check `database.sql` (if included).
- Screenshots: Check `.png` files (if included).

## Note
This project uses older tech (Java 1.6, Oracle 10g). Iâ€™m learning modern tools like Java 17 and MySQL for future projects.
